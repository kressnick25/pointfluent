# vaultSDK

Dart bindings for the vaultSDK

## Getting Started

Place all the header files from `vdk/include` in `ios/Classes/`

Place the `android_arm64` and `android_x64` folders from `vdk/lib/` into a new folder `android/src/main/jniLibs`, and rename them to `arm64-v8a` and `x86_64` respectively.
